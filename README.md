[MySQL database](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/): MySQL is an open-source relational database management system.

[Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
